Welcome to the sktime/tsbootstrap workshop at scipy 2024
========================================================

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zfruA5zy8tbDgo4OR0KyJEF7qPfPi8Si/view?usp=drive_link

This tutorial is designed for data scientists, analysts, and researchers interested in advanced time series analysis and forecasting techniques. We'll explore cutting-edge methods for enhancing uncertainty quantification and prediction accuracy in time series data, using state-of-the-art tools like [tsbootstrap](www.github.com/astrogilda/tsbootstrap) and [sktime](www.github.com/sktime/sktime).

Throughout this 4-hour session, we'll cover:

1. Fundamentals of modern time series analysis and bootstrapping methods
2. Advanced forecasting techniques and their practical applications across various domains
3. Innovative approaches to uncertainty quantification and probabilistic forecasting
4. Hands-on exercises using leading-edge tools to solve real-world time series challenges

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have gained insights into the latest developments in time series analysis and forecasting, and acquired practical skills to apply these advanced methods to your own data-driven projects.

## :rocket: How to get started

In the tutorial, we will move through notebooks section by section.

You have different options how to run the tutorial notebooks:

* Run the notebooks on your machine. [Clone] this repository, get [conda], install the required packages (`sktime`, `seaborn`, `jupyter`) in an environment, and open the notebooks with that environment. For detail instructions, see below. For troubleshooting, see sktime's more detailed [installation instructions].
* or, use python venv, and/or an editable install of this repo as a package. Instructions below.

[clone]: https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository
[conda]: https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/
[installation instructions]: https://www.sktime.net/en/latest/installation.html

Please let us know on the [sktime discord](https://discord.com/invite/54ACzaFsn7) if you have any issues during the conference, or join to ask for help anytime.

## Installation instructions for local use

To run the notebooks locally, you will need:

* a local repository clone
* a python environment with required packages installed

### Cloning the repository

To clone the repository locally:

`git clone https://github.com/astrogilda/tsbootstrap-sktime-tutorial-scipy-2024`

### Using conda env

1. Create a Python virtual environment using Conda
`conda create -y -n tsbootstrap_sktime python=3.10`
2. Activate your Conda environment
`conda activate tsbootstrap_sktime`
3. Install pip in your Conda environment (if not already installed)
`conda install -y pip`
4. Install required packages from requirements.txt using pip
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. If using Jupyter, make the environment available in Jupyter
`python -m ipykernel install --user --name=tsbootstrap_sktime`

### Using python venv

1. Create a python virtual environment:
`python -m venv tsbootstrap_sktime`
2. Activate your environment:
 - `source tsbootstrap_sktime/bin/activate` for Linux
 - `tsbootstrap_sktime/Scripts/activate` for Windows
3. Install the requirements:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. If using jupyter: make the environment available in jupyter:
`python -m ipykernel install --user --name=tsbootstrap_sktime`
