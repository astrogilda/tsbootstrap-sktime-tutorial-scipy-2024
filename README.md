Welcome to the "Enhancing Predictive Analytics with tsbootstrap and sktime" workshop at scipy 2024
============================================

This tutorial is about [sktime] - a unified framework for machine learning with time series. sktime contains algorithms and tools for building, applying, evaluating modular pipelines and composites for a variety of time series learning tasks, including forecasting, classification, regression.

`sktime` is easily extensible by anyone, and interoperable with the python data science stack.

## :rocket: How to get started

In the tutorial, we will move through notebooks section by section.

You have different options how to run the tutorial notebooks:

* Run the notebooks in the cloud on [Binder] - for this you don't have to install anything!
* Run the notebooks on your machine. [Clone] this repository, get [conda], install the required packages (`sktime`, `seaborn`, `jupyter`) in an environment, and open the notebooks with that environment. For detail instructions, see below. For troubleshooting, see sktime's more detailed [installation instructions].
* or, use python venv, and/or an editable install of this repo as a package. Instructions below.

## Installation instructions for local use

To run the notebooks locally, you will need:

* a local repository clone
* a python environment with required packages installed

### Cloning the repository

To clone the repository locally:

`git clone https://github.com/sktime/sktime-workshop-scipy-2024`

### Using conda env

1. Create a python virtual environment:
`conda create -y -n sktime_tsbootstrap python=3.12`
2. Install required packages:
`conda install -y -n sktime_tsbootstrap pip sktime tsbootstrap skpro seaborn jupyter pmdarima statsmodels`
3. Activate your environment:
`conda activate sktime_tsbootstrap`
4. If using jupyter: make the environment available in jupyter:
`python -m ipykernel install --user --name=sktime_tsbootstrap`

### Using python venv

1. Create a python virtual environment:
`python -m venv sktime_tsbootstrap`
2. Activate your environment:
 - `source sktime_tsbootstrap/bin/activate` for Linux
 - sktime_tsbootstrap/Scripts/activate` for Windows
3. Install the requirements:
`pip install -r requirements`
4. If using jupyter: make the environment available in jupyter:
`python -m ipykernel install --user --name=sktime_tsbootstrap`
